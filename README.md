# Outside-Counsel-Spend-Tableau
Overview:
My group and I worked together to analyze a comapny's legal counsel spend from 2019 to present (November 2023). By analyzing this data, the company was able to see noticeable trends to later make informed decisions based on their expenditures and costs.

Data Description:
The data will be obtained from the CounselLink legal invoicing system, and then exported to Excel for
analysis. The dataset is rather large, comprising over 10,000 rows. It has been scrubbed for privacy, with
no real names, project names, or law firm names included. The data sample we have access to is a mock
version of their invoice data that has been approved for use in this project by the company.

Methodology:
1. Import and clean the data: Load the data into Tableau and perform any necessary data cleaning and
preprocessing.
2. Data Analysis:
- Calculate the total legal outside counsel spend from 2019 to the present.
- Calculate the spend by year, spend by attorney, spend by project, and spend by law firm.
3. Report: Compile a report detailing the methodology, findings, visualizations, and any
recommendations.

Expected Outcome:
The expected outcome of this project is a comprehensive report that provides clear insights into the
company's legal outside counsel spend, with a breakdown of the key metrics identified:
- spend by year
- spend by attorney
- spend by project
- spend by law firm

Constraints:
We will need to ensure that the analysis complies with any privacy and data usage restrictions imposed
by the company. Data has been scrubbed for privacy, with no real names, project names, or law firm
names included.
